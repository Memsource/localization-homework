# Localization Homework 4
This simple projects serves as a starting point for you homework assignment. **Please start by forking this repository into your own GitHub account.**

Your goal is to setup a fully automated localization workflow in Memsource that will localize this **README.md** file into at least two languages of your choice. The localization workflow should include translation by MT engine as well as human post-editing. Assume you have two linguists, one for each language combination. Use of Translation Memory is a good practice.

When presenting your final localization workflow setup, you should demonstrate:
- your full setup in Memsource
- that modification to this file will trigger the automated workflow
- how your automated setup actually works, by guiding us through the process of localizing the changes made in the previous step
- how finishing the localization of the changes propagate to the GitHub repository
- what were your pain points and which areas of the process would you try to improve

I have modified this sentence again to demostrate how a change of this file triggers the automated localization workflow.
